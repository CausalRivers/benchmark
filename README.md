# CausalRivers
### A large-scale Causal Discovery benchmark for time series

Install via:
1. Install env via ./install.sh
2. Script to generate graph subsets from the paper categories: 0_generate_datsets.py


## Further functionality:
- Tutorial on how to build your own graph subset:  [Custom graph sampling](1_custom_graph_sampling.ipynb)
- Tutorial on how to use the benchmark most efficiently:  [Custom graph sampling](2_tutorial_benchmarking.ipynb)
- Tutorial on how to subselect specific temporal windows with certain weather conditions:    [Custom graph sampling](3_tutorial_subselect_weather_condition.ipynb)[Custom graph sampling](2_tutorial_benchmarking.ipynb)
- Some general display of dataset properties that might be interesting for users:  [Custom graph sampling](4_data_distribution.ipynb)
- Graphical documentation for paper content:  [Graphics generation ](graphics)




If you want to further reproduce the experimental results or compare your method under equal conditions, please clone: 
https://github.com/CausalRivers/experiments (into the main folder)

### High prio todos: 

- Script for data downloading if called (and generally fix install)
- Slim down the tools.
- Properly update the tutorials
- Tuttorial on the standard usage (to equalize)
